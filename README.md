# zOMBIE-Survival
This website is a collection of zombie survival tips,tricks and items. Build your own B.O.B.(Bug out Bag). Will you survive the Zombie Apocalypse?

What is a Bug-out-Bag you may ask?


Off-the-shelf Red Cross preparedness kit
A bug-out bag or BOB is a portable kit that normally contains the items one would require to survive for 72 hours when evacuating from a disaster, although some kits are designed to last longer periods. Other names for such a bag are a BOB, 72-hour kit, a grab bag, battle box, personal emergency relocation kit (PERK), go bag, GOOD bag (get out of Dodge) INCH bag (I'm never coming home) or quick run bag (QRB).

## Motivation

I was motivated to make this app because I really love Zombies and the thought of being able to create your own personal B.O.B and save it was amazing to me. A lot of people don't know about B.O.B's so I think this will be very educational.

FROM bob
JOIN weapons ON weapons.id = weapons_id
JOIN beverages ON beverages_id = beverages.id
JOIN tips ON tips_id = tips.id
WHERE bob.id = $1;
`, id);
  },

 // Get one bob by id (controller)
  getOne(req, res, next) {
    db.findById(req.params.id)
      .then((bob) => {
        res.locals.bob = bob;
        next();
      })
      .catch(err => next(err));
  },

```

## How to Use:
To test it out yourself, feel free to fork and clone my repo. If you want to play the actual game, I provided the link above to the game!

## Unsolved Problems:

1. Getting the Update/Edit function to actually update/edit instead of creating a new BOB altogether. 
1. In the create form, allowing users to input text instead of numbers/


### Things to be added later:
1. Implementing user login/register.
1. Design website using Bulma.
1. Make it so that users can only delete the BOBs they created.
1. Make it so that users can create a collection of BOBs they like.
1. Allow users to add multiples of certain items.
1. Allowing users to add their own things to a BOB.
